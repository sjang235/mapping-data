       "  3005: 'The 2015 Sugar Shack Estate Chardonnay is a wine of immense proportion and is a thrill to drink. Full of brazen character, it astonishingly never crosses the line. Please note the greenish hue on the edge of the glass, which is indicative of the health of the wine. An inviting nose of honeyed citrus, candle wax, florals and a hint of bacon fat. Flavors focus on golden apple juice with baking spice and fennel adding complexity. A creamy texture frames the tasting experience, while the acid wash keeps this liquid confection lively and in check. The 2015 Sugar Shack will probably last a decade, but why wait? The wine is slightly hazy showing their commitment to minimal intervention winemaking.',\n",

       "  9758: 'The most sought-after wine in our portfolio, this limited-production Cabernet Sauvignon represents the pinnacle of Chappellet winemaking and embodies the elegant power and complexity of Pritchard Hill winegrowing. Like the great Bordeaux wines that first inspired Donn Chappellet, this wine is crafted by blending Cabernet Sauvignon with other classic Bordeaux varietals. The wine was aged for 22 months in 100% new French oak. Grown on our rocky, mountainside vineyard, our Cabernets have consistently displayed an ability to age for several decades.',\n",

       "  '14353': 'Dark purple with vermillion-tinged edges, the plush and refreshing 2014 Stags Leap District Cabernet Sauvignon lures the taster with a multidimensional perfume that fills the glass with notes of jasmine, lavender, and spring flowers.

Loads of smoked cardamom, cinnamon, and black licorice unwind onto the palate where the vibrant acidity carries the long finish to a state of balance and equilibrium. ',\n",
       "  '16309': 'Dense garnet to violet, viscous mouth feel. Bright ripe fruit, beautiful floral and intense dark fruit aromas that are expansive in the mouth and evocative of sweet violets, raspberries, blackberries and some woodsy notes. The wine is rich and dense with an excellent balance of black fruit to tannins. Completely balanced. Overall impression is of lots of fruit and lots of tannins with lots of layers and depths. Unified and seamless, elixir like. ',\n",
       "  '16327': 'Pure Maya! Sweet, ripe fruit and a full, round mouth feel. Big massive, muscular wine and still a bit closed. Pronounced fruit with mineral components. The wine is austere and has lots of sophistication. Less acid, more oak, and excellent tannin management.',\n",
       "  '16395': 'The 2016 Lotus displays aromas of black cherry, berry compote, wet stone, and wet earth. The wine is full bodied with a creamy texture. It captures the essence of Lotus Vineyard in its firm structure and concentration while retaining vibrancy and balance. Classic black fruits and warm spice flavors coat the palate mingling with hints of dried herbs and a firm structured finish. Enjoy 2020 through 2038 and beyond.',\n",
       "  '27380': 'All Hundred Acre wines are made by sorting the fruit berry by berry, fermenting in small French oak fermenters, and long aging in the finest barriques. The secret to Hundred Acre is no compromise and no detail overlooked, ever.',\n",
