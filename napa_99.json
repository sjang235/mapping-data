Please note the greenish hue on the edge of the glass, which is indicative of the health of the wine. An inviting nose of honeyed citrus, candle wax, florals and a hint of bacon fat. Flavors focus on golden apple juice with baking spice and fennel adding complexity. A creamy texture frames the tasting experience, while the acid wash keeps this liquid confection lively and in check. The 2015 Sugar Shack will probably last a decade, but why wait? The wine is slightly hazy showing their commitment to minimal intervention winemaking.", "4667": "The Harbison Cabernet Sauvignon also has great power and intensity that makes for a rock star wine.

Like the great Bordeaux wines that first inspired Donn Chappellet, this wine is crafted by blending Cabernet Sauvignon with other classic Bordeaux varietals. The wine was aged for 22 months in 100% new French oak. Grown on our rocky, mountainside vineyard, our Cabernets have consistently displayed an ability to age for several decades.", "14352": "Dark purple with vermillion-tinged edges, the plush and refreshing 2014 Stags Leap District Cabernet Sauvignon lures the taster with a multidimensional perfume that fills the glass with notes of jasmine, lavender, and spring flowers.

Loads of smoked cardamom, cinnamon, and black licorice unwind onto the palate where the vibrant acidity carries the long finish to a state of balance and equilibrium.

Bright ripe fruit, beautiful floral and intense dark fruit aromas that are expansive in the mouth and evocative of sweet violets, raspberries, blackberries and some woodsy notes.

The wine is full bodied with a creamy texture. It captures the essence of Lotus Vineyard in its firm structure and concentration while retaining vibrancy and balance.
